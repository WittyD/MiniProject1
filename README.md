# DATA TRANSMISSION USING LED
When a current is applied to an LED light bulb, a constant stream of light is 	emitted from the bulb, which is an illumination.
And the transmitted light can be modulated at extremely high-speeds, it is detected by the photo detector at the receiver end,
Which in turn, is converted back to electrical current, therefore carrying the data.
In this project, we transmit data from one Arduino to another using light(LED) which is received at the photo detector of the receiver end.

REQUIREMENTS : 2 Arduino UNO boards, LDR(5 ohm), 2 LEDâ€™S, switch ,rotary potentiometer ,2 (220 ohm) resistors
